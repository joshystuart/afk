# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-10)

**Core value:** Secure agentic coding without DX compromise — containers provide isolation that can't be circumvented, while the UI makes working inside them feel as natural as working locally.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — session-ux

## Current Position

Phase: 2

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Skills must be read-only bind mounts (security constraint from PROJECT.md)
- Agents must be CLI-invoked inside containers, no API-level integration
- nest-typed-config for infra config, Settings entity for user-configurable options

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Cursor CLI non-interactive behavior in Docker needs spike/validation before Phase 3 execution
- Multi-agent concurrency model (locking/queuing) deferred to v2 (AGNT-04)
